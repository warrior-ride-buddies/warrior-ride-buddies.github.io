## Overview
The goal of Warrior Ride Buddies is to connect UH Manoa students with similar commutes, enabling them to organize car-pools. 
This application will help students save money on gas and parking.

## User Guide
- Start off by creating your profile including your name, profile photo, UH email address, and neighborhood.
- Categorize yourself as a driver, rider, or both if you’re willing.
- Drivers must include the following information about their car: year, make/model, and license plate.
- Rider’s will have a recommended gas-money contribution for their drivers depending on their distance from campus.
- Adjust your desired arrival times for each day of the week.
- Once your profile is completed, it will be visible on the app’s home page, which is a map populated with other commuters shown in their general starting locations. Users can interact with the map by clicking on other’s profiles and filtering them by various categories.
- Coordinate with other users that have similar commutes by clicking their profile and using our in-app messaging system.
