## Overview
The goal of Warrior Ride Buddies is to connect UH Manoa students with similar commutes, enabling them to organize car-pools. 
This application will help students save money on gas and parking.

Here is the link to our [organization](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies) and the [team contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwVIlZwdnLveOPWr_WfwH-5iD-kGBiF5fv1-mwz5sEc/edit?usp=sharing) we created at the beginning of this project.

## User Guide
- Start off by creating your profile including your name, profile photo, UH email address, and neighborhood.
- Categorize yourself as a driver, rider, or both if you’re willing.
- Drivers must include the following information about their car: year, make/model, and license plate.
- Riders will have a recommended gas-money contribution for their drivers depending on their distance from campus.
- Adjust your desired arrival times for each day of the week.
- Once your profile is completed, it will be visible on the app’s home page, which is a map populated with other commuters shown in their general starting locations. Users can interact with the map by clicking on other’s profiles and filtering them by various categories.
- Coordinate with other users that have similar commutes by clicking their profile and using our in-app messaging system.

### Deployment
Here is our [deployed app](http://188.166.83.198/#/).

### Screenshots of Mockups

On the landing page, the user can gain more insight about how the application works.
</p>

<p><img src="images/HomePage.png">
Using the filters on the left, users can search for other users (driver/riders) that are suitable for their schedule. Specifically, users can filter by time, day of the week, and driver/rider. Additionally, they can clear the filter by clicking on the bottom right erase icon.</p>

<p><img src="images/MapPin.png">
Clicking on users will reveal a modal that gives more information about the user. Eventually, users will be able to click on a button to message this user to carpool.</p>

<p><img src="images/InboxPage.png">
Once riders or drivers discover people that they can carpool with, they can message people through the application. This page keeps track of users this user has messaged. </p>

<p><img src="images/Messages.png">
After clicking on a user on the inbox page, past messages are displayed on a modal.</p>

<p><img src="images/ProfilePage.png">
Every user has a profile page that contains information about themselves that are pertinent to the application (i.e. Name, location, car information, and up-to-date schedule)</p>

<p><img src="images/EditProfilePage.png">
If needed, users can edit information about themselves through this form.</p>

<p><img src="images/ViewProfilesPage.png">
This page allows users to view all of the profiles available in the application.</p>

If anyone is reported, the report is displayed here for admin users to review and take action.</p>

## Development History
### Milestone #1:
[M1 project page](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies/warrior-ride-buddies/projects/1)

For this milestone, our teammates dedicated around a week and half. In this time we:
* Brainstormed what we wanted this application to do.
* Created mockup pages of what the application should look like and what functionality the application will have.
* Created issues and came up with future "quality of life" updates to be done to the application in the future.
* Divided the issues up so that each member has at least 2 issues.

### Milestone #2:
[M2 project page](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies/warrior-ride-buddies/projects/2)

For this milestone, our teammates dedicated around a week and half. In this time we:
* Allowed users to create and edit accounts that are usable in the application
  * Location and time per day can be specified per person
  * Car information can be recorded
* Allowed users to filter pins on the main page to find riders or drivers suitable for their schedule
* Gave users the ability to message other users through the application

### Milestone #3:

## Future ideas to implement
* Deal with Unsolicited Interactions (Blocking, etc.)
* Allow group chats
* Convert Web app to React Native
* Provided a recommended tip/gratuity
* Allow users to go from UH to Home
