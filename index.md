## Overview
The goal of Warrior Ride Buddies is to connect UH Manoa students with similar commutes, enabling them to organize car-pools. 
This application will help students save money on gas and parking.

Here is our [organization page.](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies)

## User Guide
- Start off by creating your profile including your name, profile photo, UH email address, and neighborhood.
- Categorize yourself as a driver, rider, or both if you’re willing.
- Drivers must include the following information about their car: year, make/model, and license plate.
- Riders will have a recommended gas-money contribution for their drivers depending on their distance from campus.
- Adjust your desired arrival times for each day of the week.
- Once your profile is completed, it will be visible on the app’s home page, which is a map populated with other commuters shown in their general starting locations. Users can interact with the map by clicking on other’s profiles and filtering them by various categories.
- Coordinate with other users that have similar commutes by clicking their profile and using our in-app messaging system.

## Development History
### Milestone #1:
[M1 project page](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies/warrior-ride-buddies/projects/1)

For this milestone, our teammates dedicated around a week and half. In this time we:
* Brainstormed what we wanted this application to do.
* Created mockup pages of what the application should look like and what functionality the application will have.
* Created issues and came up with future "quality of life" updates to be done to the application in the future.
* Divided the issues up so that each member has at least 2 issues.

### Milestone #2:
[M2 project page](https://github.com/warrior-ride-buddies/warrior-ride-buddies/projects/2)
